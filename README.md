# SQL_Alchemy_Challenge

Title- Homework Module 10 SQL Alchemy Challenge- Conner Dekok
In this assignment we used Python and SQL Alchemy to create this project.  We looked at Hawaii weather data for our data set. 
Collaboration with other students- I worked with Hunter Becke on this project.  We worked together on completing this project and comparing our results with one another to help make sure we were on the right track when it came to completing this assignment. 
I reviewed the in-class meetings and reviewed the examples we went through in these class lessons. This helped me create some of my starter code along with comments that I used throughout my code. 
I used Microsoft copilot to help correct or ask any questions and bugs I had when creating my code.
